I have created a landing page of the website and the navbar. As user clicks on the Onboarding of the navbar the user will be redirected to the onboarding page. As the user get redirected to onboarding page the user will see the videos playing on the page and after certain interval of time the user will be able to see the next video. The user can also skip the video or go to previous video. The user can also close the videos playing and again if the user wants to see the videos again then the user can click on view button.
